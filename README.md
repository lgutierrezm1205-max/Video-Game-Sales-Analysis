🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis – TripleTen Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global video game sales using open-source data from the online store Ice, which distributes games worldwide.
The dataset includes user and critic reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation), ESRB ratings, and regional sales.

The main objective is to identify the patterns that influence whether a game becomes successful. These insights can help detect promising projects and guide marketing and advertising strategies.

🎯 Business Goal
